# Blueprint Program

The GraphQL resolver really flexes its true power when used with `jsonParsed`
encoding for accounts or transactions (instructions).

This allows us to define usable types, which implement the general
interface(s), and provide powerful matching and field-accessing capabilities.

What if the interface-implemented types could be parsed using user-defined
schemas stored on-chain?
